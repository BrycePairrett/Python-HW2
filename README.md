# Python-HW2

<H1> Spin the Wheel </H1>
<body> The game is played as follows:

* Spin a wheel with a group of numbers (0-10).
If you got a 1, 2 or a 3, the game is over.
''' If you got a 4, 5, or 6, you win that many dollars ($4, $5, or $6), and then spin again, or
if you got 7, 8, 9, or 10, then you win $14,$16,$18, or $20 and then spin again. 
If you got a 0, then you lose 50% of what you won so far, but are allowed to spin again.
With each additional spin, you have the chance to win more money, or you might play the game-ending 1, 2, or 3, at which time the game is over and you keep whatever winnings you have accumulated.
